Hello! My name is Anton. I'm a researcher in autonomous robotics with a particular interest in computer vision (3D point cloud semantic segmentation) and deep learning for robust 3D perception. I am also broadly interested in SLAM.

I am currently a Data Scientist (ML Matching Team) at [OZON](https://corp.ozon.com/) Technology in Russia. Prior to this role, I served as Middle Software Developer (Localization and Mapping (SLAM) team) in Self-Driving Group in the same company. I have been working on developing of algorithms that underlie SLAM.

From August 2020 to June 2021, I was a doctaral student at [Autonomous Transportation Systems Lab](https://robotics.innopolis.university/en/labs/laboratoriya-avtonomnyh-transportnyh-sistem/) of [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/) with [*Professor Alexandr Klimchik*](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=KLpMBj0AAAAJ&hl=en). I received my <strong>Master of Science in Space and Engineering Systems</strong> at [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech)](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/) in June 2020 — including a six-month research visit at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

My Master's research work was based at [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of [*Professor Howie Choset*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4fvo61oAAAAJ&hl=en) — related to the development of a new 3D Place Recognition framework in 3D LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm with an orientation-invariant property.

          <p>To solve a scene divergence under the interference of dynamic environments, effective perception of observation and object layout variance from different viewpoints, my group developed a PSE-Match, a viewpoint-free place ecognition method based on parallel semantic analysis of isolated semantic attributes from 3D point-cloud models.
